# Excel Revenue Forecasting from Ad Spend

This portfolio project focuses on forecasting sales performance from advertising investments — developed entirely in Excel as part of an advanced data analytics and marketing strategy course.

The analysis is based on a simulated dataset for *MarketEdge Digital*, a digital marketing company aiming to understand how advertising investments influence weekly sales, optimize marketing budgets, and maximize ROI through predictive analytics.

## Project Goals

- Analyze the relationship between **advertising spend** and **sales performance**  
- Build a **linear regression model** to predict revenue from marketing investments  
- Use **forecasting and extrapolation** to simulate higher budget scenarios  
- Interpret results to support **data-driven marketing strategy and budget allocation**

---

## Key Techniques

- Data cleaning and descriptive statistics  
- Scatter plot and correlation analysis (Ad Spend vs Revenue)  
- Linear regression modeling (equation, coefficients, R²)  
- Forecasting using Excel’s `FORECAST.LINEAR()` function  
- Extrapolation beyond historical data for strategic planning  
- Insight writing and actionable marketing interpretation

## Executive Summary

This project demonstrates a perfectly linear relationship between advertising spend and sales performance, with an R² of 1.00.  
The regression model shows that each additional euro invested in advertising generates approximately **€3.4 in revenue**, highlighting the direct and proportional impact of marketing investments on sales.

The forecast and extrapolation analysis further confirm that, under this idealized scenario, increasing advertising budgets leads to proportional revenue growth.  
While such perfect predictability is unrealistic in real markets, this project clearly illustrates how **predictive analytics can support marketing decisions**, enabling smarter budget allocation and data-backed ROI optimization.
